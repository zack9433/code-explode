## Welcome to Brew Everywhere!

Brew Everywhere is a sample AngularJS App that tries to demonstrate how to use AngularJS for a larger app. Brew Everywhere also takes a functional approach to organizing the application structure. The views, controllers, directives, filters and services are grouped based on their function within the app. Services, directives and filters that are used by multiple modules are in their own separate module to indicate re-use candidates.

When complete Brew Everywhere will provide a Home Brewing Social Site that allows users to track their brewing activities and share recipes with other users.
